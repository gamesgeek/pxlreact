"""
pxl_status.py provides the StatusHub: a thread-safe store the core publishes runtime state into,
consumed by the DPG status bar (see pxl_statusbar.py).

The hub is the single reporting funnel for gameplay state. Publishers call its record methods
instead of printing; gameplay events produce no terminal output (the status bar is the display).
The hub deliberately does NOT import dearpygui, so a headless run (statusbar disabled) carries
no GUI dependency.

Publishers / threads:
- main poll loop: set_active(), reaction fires (via PxlReactionRegistry._log_reaction)
- PxlRemapper thread: ability fires (record_ability), presses dropped during a cast (record_drop)
Consumers: the status bar render thread reads snapshots under the same lock.

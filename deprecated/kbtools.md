# kbtools.py
kbtools (a moniker for "keyboard tools") is a simple, lightweight project designed to borrow some
of the features and functionality of the pxlreact project while greatly simplifying the design.

In short, the goal of kbtools is to create basic "macro" and "remapping" functionality for standard
key inputs with a small amount of added behavior derived from the color of specific pixels on the
screen at or around the time of those key inputs. It aims to turn single key inputs into short
sequences where appropriate to simplify and optimize tasks that require frequent, repeated
key sequences that are nonetheless conditional (i.e., should only occur under certain conditions).

- ansi.py provides global shorthand for ANSI colors to use within f-strings for basic output
highlighting to improve readability; modules can import * from ansi
- Apply some basic conventions: RED for errors, failures, YELLOW for warnings, GREEN for confirmation
and success, MAGENTA for numeric data and variables, CYAN for filenames and I/O
- Example: print( f'{RED}Error: bad configuration{RESET}' )

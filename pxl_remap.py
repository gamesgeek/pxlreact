"""
pxl_remap.py provides keyboard-capture remapping for PxlReact.

A remap intercepts a single physical "source" key and, when pressed, sends the first qualifying key
from an ordered sequence. Qualification is driven by a per-entry predicate: a timed sequence uses
per-key cooldown timers, while a pixel-color sequence uses live pixel-color tests.

Capturing (as opposed to sending, which PxlIntercept handles) requires its own Interception context
with a keyboard filter and a blocking await/receive/send loop run on a background thread.

    Substitutes are sent through this same capture context, on the loop thread. Sends from the
    filter-owning context pass downstream without being re-intercepted (the same path as ordinary
    passed-through typing), which is what makes a source-equal substitute such as e -> e work; an

    swallowed. Sending on the loop thread also avoids racing the device's shared stroke buffer
    against receive().
